    <h2 class="goals">Goals and Aspirations</h2> 
    <p> Currently I am studying to recieve my bachelor's degree in visual communication design. During my sophomore year of high school is when I truly gained a strong interest in the art of graphic design. I've always enjoyed doing art as a hobby and I consider myself to be a fast learner when it comes to learning technology. Since then I still enjoy being able to think creatively but have realized that graphic design isn't ultimately all I want to do in life. After I graduate I want to further my education and attend graduate school to earn my masters in social work. I hope to have a career in this field later on in life because going out of my way to help people and putting others before myself is what I've always been known to do. I also play on the women's basketball team here and plan to play professionally overseas immediately after I graduate. Obviously I have a few plans, but if i have the chance to play overseas then I definitely want to pursue that first because if given the oppurtunity, I'll be able to experience a ton of new things and who wouldn't want to travel?</p>
